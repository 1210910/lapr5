In this markdown file, will be describing the process of creating a new building, where the authentication is implemented.

## LOGIN ##
Using Auth0, the user is logged in, and the token is stored in the local storage. The token is used to authenticate the user in the backend:
![AfterLogin](./Visualization/afterLogin.png)

After that, the user is redirected to their home page:
![Redirect](./Visualization/redirect.png)

If a user try to access a page that requires authentication, and the user is not logged in, the user is redirected to the login page:
![Components](./Visualization/components.png)

## BACKEND REQUESTS ##
In the backend, when a user (in this example a campus manager) requests a service, the HTTP request will have a header with the authorization token (if there is no token, the request will be rejected):
![Header](./InformationManager/request.png)

With the token, the backend can verify if the user is authenticated, and if the user has the permission to access the requested service:
![Routes](./InformationManager/routes.png)

For that to be possible, 2 middlewares were created:
- isAuth: that verifies if the user is authenticated
![isAuth](./InformationManager/userRole.png)

- userRole: that verifies if the user has the permission to access the requested service
![userRole](./InformationManager/isAuth.png)
